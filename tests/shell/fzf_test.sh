# fzf adds interactive fuzzy search (Ctrl-R history, Ctrl-T files, Alt-C cd) —
# complementing zsh-autosuggestions, not replacing it. The runtime side (zshrc
# still starting cleanly WITHOUT fzf) is covered by zsh_startup_test.sh; this
# pins the wiring statically so a future edit can't silently drop it.
