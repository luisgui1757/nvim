## Install

### One-shot, from scratch (recommended)

No checkout needed. `setup.{sh,ps1}` clones the repo to `~/dotfiles`
(or `%USERPROFILE%\dotfiles` on Windows), installs every dependency,
symlinks every config, and finishes with `:Lazy! sync` +
`:MasonToolsInstallSync` so LSP servers and formatters are downloaded
before nvim even opens.

```bash
# mac / linux / wsl
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luisgui1757/dotfiles/main/setup.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# windows -- run elevated OR with Developer Mode enabled (Settings ->
# Privacy & security -> For developers -> Developer Mode = On)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luisgui1757/dotfiles/main/setup.ps1 | iex
```

Add `--all` / `-All` for fully non-interactive (Y to every prompt).
Add `--dry-run` / `-DryRun` to preview every step without touching disk.

### From an existing checkout

```bash
./setup.sh                       # Y/n per dep, end-to-end
./setup.sh --all                 # non-interactive
./setup.sh --dry-run             # preview
./setup.sh --skip-deps           # already installed; just bootstrap + sync
./setup.sh --skip-bootstrap      # already symlinked; just sync plugins + LSP
make setup                       # same as ./setup.sh, via the Makefile
```

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
.\setup.ps1 -All
.\setup.ps1 -DryRun
.\setup.ps1 -MergeWindowsTerminal     # also apply the WT rose-pine fragment
```

### Or invoke the phases manually

`setup.{sh,ps1}` is a thin orchestrator. Each phase is also a
standalone, idempotent script:

```bash
./install-deps.sh                # phase 1: package-manager installs
./bootstrap.sh                   # phase 2: symlink configs
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa            # phase 3: plugins
nvim --headless "+MasonToolsInstallSync" +qa # phase 4: LSP + formatters
```

```powershell
.\install-deps.ps1
.\bootstrap.ps1
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" "+qa"
nvim --headless "+MasonToolsInstallSync" "+qa"
```

Phase 1 (`install-deps.sh`) also offers to make **zsh your login shell**
(`chsh`) — installing the package alone doesn't, so without this step tmux and
new terminals on Linux keep launching bash and never source the symlinked
`~/.zshrc`. It's consent-gated (auto-yes under `--all`), idempotent, and
no-ops on macOS (already zsh). The change takes effect after the next login.
On **domain / AD / LDAP** machines the account isn't in `/etc/passwd`, so
`chsh` can't help — there it instead offers to re-exec interactive bash into
zsh from `~/.bashrc` (reversible).

Every script is idempotent — re-running is a no-op when everything is
already in place. Pre-existing non-symlink targets are backed up to
`<target>.bak.<timestamp>` (collision-proof: `.1`, `.2`, … if reused).

## Test

```bash
make help           # list targets
make test           # run everything that can run on this OS
make test-bootstrap # bats coverage of the installer
make lint           # shellcheck everything
```

Sub-targets skip themselves with a `skipped: <tool> not installed` message
when their dependency tool is missing on the current machine.

## Key design decisions (and why)

- **One source of truth via symlinks.** Edits in the repo are live everywhere
  without manual copy-paste; `bootstrap.{sh,ps1}` are idempotent.
- **Rose Pine everywhere it can render.** Nvim, lualine, starship, tmux,
  ghostty, Windows Terminal, PSReadLine — same palette across the stack.
- **conform.nvim is the only format-on-save handler.** Replacing the
  prior LSP-attach autocmd + null-ls duo eliminates a real race condition
  with different timeouts. `:WNF` (or `:wnf`) skips formatting for one save.
- **Mason installs LSP servers + formatters via mason-tool-installer.** No
  `mason-lspconfig` — redundant on nvim 0.11 with `vim.lsp.enable`.
- **Starship language modules pared down.** Only `c, go, node, rust, python,
  conda` are enabled. Disabled languages don't spawn version probes on every
  prompt.
- **Zsh starship init is precompiled** (mirroring the PowerShell profile
  approach) — re-generated only when `starship.toml` is newer than the cache.
- **No `bindkey '\e' kill-whole-line`** — that shadowed the entire Meta
  prefix and silently broke Alt-h/j/k/l window nav in nvim.
- **Windows Terminal settings.json is NOT symlinked** because WT auto-rewrites
  it. Only the user-owned keys live in `settings.fragment.jsonc`; the install
  script merges them in.

See `CLAUDE.md` for the operational guide (invariants, common workflows,
conventions).

## Daily workflows

### `:wnf` — write without formatting

In any buffer: `:wnf<CR>` (lowercase) saves the file with formatters skipped
**for this one save**. The next plain `:w` formats normally. Useful in legacy
codebases where the formatter would create a noisy diff. Implemented in
`nvim/lua/vim-options.lua`.

### Adding a plugin

Drop one file at `nvim/lua/plugins/<name>.lua` returning the lazy spec.
Lazy auto-discovers it. Default to lazy-loading (`event` / `cmd` / `keys` /
`ft`). Only `rose-pine` may set `lazy = false`.

### Adding an LSP server / formatter / treesitter parser

See `CLAUDE.md` → "Common workflows". Three small edits each: the plugin
spec, the Mason ensure_installed list, and the corresponding test under
`tests/nvim/spec/`.

### Refreshing the plugin lockfile

```bash
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa
git add nvim/lazy-lock.json   # tracked, not gitignored
```

### Updating Mason tools across machines

```bash
nvim --headless "+MasonToolsUpdate" +qa
```

Run on each machine; there's no machine-pinned lockfile for Mason itself.

### Switching machines mid-session

```bash
git -C ~/dotfiles pull          # sync configs
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa     # match plugin commits
make test                       # verify the new state
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `<leader>X` keymaps fire `\X` instead of `<Space>X` | mapleader set after lazy.setup somehow | restore the order in `nvim/init.lua` — leader **before** `require("lazy").setup` |
| Formatter runs twice or shows two BufWritePre autocmds | someone added a second handler outside conform.nvim | `:lua print(#vim.api.nvim_get_autocmds({event="BufWritePre"}))` should be 1; if not, find the second autocmd and delete it |
| Clipboard not crossing host on WSL | `win32yank.exe` not on PATH | install win32yank via scoop on Windows side, ensure WSL PATH picks it up |
| Starship prompt slow | a disabled language got re-enabled | check `starship/starship.toml` — only `c, go, nodejs, rust, python, conda` should be enabled |
| `Alt-h/j/k/l` window nav doesn't work in terminal | something rebinds bare Esc in the shell | `bindkey | grep '^"\^\['` in zsh — should NOT show `kill-whole-line` |
| tmux (or any new terminal) launches **bash on Linux**, not zsh | the login shell was never changed — `~/.zshrc` is symlinked but the account still logs into bash | re-run `./install-deps.sh` and accept "Make zsh your default login shell?", or `chsh -s "$(command -v zsh)"` then log out/in. macOS already defaults to zsh |
| `chsh` fails with `user '<name>' does not exist in /etc/passwd` | you log in via a **domain** account (AD/LDAP/SSSD) that isn't in local `/etc/passwd`, so `chsh` can't touch it | re-run `./install-deps.sh` — it detects this and offers to re-exec interactive bash into zsh via `~/.bashrc` instead. The "proper" fix is admin-side: set the directory `loginShell` / SSSD `default_shell` |
| Ghostty doesn't open maximized | `window-save-state` restored an old smaller geometry over `maximize` (macOS only) | keep `window-save-state = never` in `ghostty/config` — `maximize = true` needs it or the saved size wins |
| Ghostty doesn't load the config | wrong path | the install path is `~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config` on macOS, `~/.config/ghostty/config` on Linux. `bootstrap.sh` handles this |
| Windows Terminal lost a profile after merge | WT auto-rewrites — pre-merge backup is at `<settings.json>.bak.<timestamp>` | restore the profile list from the backup |
| `bootstrap.ps1` errors "cannot create symbolic links" | Developer Mode off and not elevated | enable Developer Mode (Settings → Privacy & security → For developers) OR run from an elevated PowerShell |
